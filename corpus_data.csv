Editor’s Note,By Adrian Matejka,An introduction to our June Jordan folio.
Margaret Walker’s “For My People”,By CM Burroughs,"There is lightness within these downtrodden lives! What does it mean if a poem is “neither pro nor con abortion”? A hymn to female independence in the form of a withering critique of marriage Who are all these people? Where is this waste land they inhabit? What is this chaos of impressions we are privy to? Wherefore such madness? Are these pieces translations, inventions, or interventions that add to a story that has been lost to us? A queer childhood and the demand to “sound straight.” When polite prejudice makes for scathing satire. A letter, a list, a sonnet, and the state of a nation. Bridging two languages and generations in one intricate poem. This short poem about dreams is one of the most influential poems of the 20th century."
