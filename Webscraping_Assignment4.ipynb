Wherefore such madness? Are these pieces translations, inventions, or interventions that add to a story that has been lost to us? A queer childhood and the demand to “sound straight.” When polite prejudice makes for scathing satire. A letter, a list, a sonnet, and the state of a nation.

The dataset provides information about 2,000 films from 1925 to 2015, including characters’ names, genders, ages, how many words each character spoke in each film, the release year of each film, and how much money the film grossed. They included character gender information because they wanted to contribute data to a broader conversation about how \"white men dominate movie roles.\""
